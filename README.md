This Spring Boot project is a RESTful web service for managing job posts. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the flow and working of the project:

1. **Model Layer**:
   - `JobPost.java`: This class represents the data model for a job post. It includes fields like `postId`, `postProfile`, `postDesc`, `reqExperience`, and `postTechStack`. It uses Lombok annotations to generate boilerplate code like getters, setters, constructors, etc.

2. **Repository Layer**:
   - `JobRepo.java`: This class acts as an in-memory repository for storing job posts. It initializes a list of `JobPost` objects and provides methods to perform CRUD operations:
     - `getAllJobs()`: Returns the list of all job posts.
     - `addJob(JobPost job)`: Adds a new job post to the list.
     - `getJob(int i)`: Retrieves a job post by its ID.
     - `updateJob(JobPost jobPost, int postId)`: Updates an existing job post.
     - `deleteJob(int postId)`: Deletes a job post by its ID.

3. **Service Layer**:
   - `JobService.java`: This class provides business logic for job post operations. It uses `JobRepo` to interact with the data:
     - `addJob(JobPost jobPost)`: Adds a new job post.
     - `getALlJobs()`: Retrieves all job posts.
     - `getJob(int i)`: Retrieves a job post by its ID.
     - `updateJob(JobPost jobPost, int postId)`: Updates an existing job post.
     - `deleteJob(int postId)`: Deletes a job post by its ID.

4. **Controller Layer**:
   - `RestJobController.java`: This class handles HTTP requests and maps them to the appropriate service methods:
     - `getAllJobs()`: Handles `GET` requests to `/jobPosts` and returns a list of all job posts.
     - `getJob(int postId)`: Handles `GET` requests to `/jobPost/{postId}` and returns a specific job post by its ID.
     - `addJob(JobPost jobPost)`: Handles `POST` requests to `/jobPost` and adds a new job post.
     - `updateJob(JobPost jobPost, int postId)`: Handles `PUT` requests to `/jobPost/{postId}` and updates an existing job post.
     - `deleteJob(int postId)`: Handles `DELETE` requests to `/jobPost/{postId}` and deletes a job post by its ID.

**Flow**:
1. A client sends an HTTP request to one of the endpoints defined in `RestJobController`.
2. The controller method processes the request and calls the corresponding method in `JobService`.
3. `JobService` interacts with `JobRepo` to perform the necessary CRUD operation.
4. The result is returned back through the service and controller layers to the client as an HTTP response.

This structure follows the typical Spring Boot architecture with clear separation of concerns between the model, repository, service, and controller layers.
